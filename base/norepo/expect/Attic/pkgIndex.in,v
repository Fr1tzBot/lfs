@
	* Makefile.in: [Bug 865278] Semi-applied Don Porter's patch adding
	code which prevents the package from registering with Tcl
	interpreters which cannot load it, i.e. below the version it was
	compiled against. Semi because the pkgIndex.in in his patch is
	not used, the pkgIndex.tcl is generated by the Makefile(.in).
	* pkgIndex.in: Removed. File not used.

@# Tcl package index file, version 1.0
# This file is sourced either when an application starts up or
# by a "package unknown" script.  It invokes the
# "package ifneeded" command to set up package-related
# information so that packages will be loaded automatically
# in response to "package require" commands.  When this
# script is sourced, the variable $dir must contain the
# full path name of this file's directory.
