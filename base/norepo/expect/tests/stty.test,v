	* Resynchronization of SourceForge with Don's sources to Expect
	  version 5.34. The changes are

	  Don Porter <don.porter@@nist.gov> provided package-related fixes
	  for test suite.

	  Brian Theado <brian.theado@@usa.net> noted that interact's -re
	  support broke when offsets kicked in.  Turned out that the
	  regexp engine supports them during execution but the results are
	  delivered RELATIVE to the offset.  (I suspect this was done
	  due to expediency.)
