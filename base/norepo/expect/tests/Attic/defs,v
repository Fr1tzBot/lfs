@* Makefile.in: Changed test target to source tests/all.tcl instead
of tests/all

* tests/README: Modified documentation to reflect the change from
usage of a defs file to the use of package tcltest to run the tests

* tests/all:
* tests/defs:
* tests/all.tcl:
* tests/cat.test:
* tests/expect.test:
* tests/logfile.test:
* tests/pid.test:
* tests/send.test:
* tests/spawn.test
* tests/stty.test: Modified test files to use package tcltest,
removed tests/all and tests/defs, and added tests/all.tcl
