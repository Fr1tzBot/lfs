	* configure.in: Bumped version to 5.44.1.6.
	* configure: Regen'd, autoconf 2.59.

	* The following set of changes was sent our way by Reinhard Max
	  <max@@tclers.tk>.

	* configure.in: Fixed checking of stty on linux, do not restrict
	  to specific cpu's. Further try with stdin, and stdin redirected
	  to /dev/tty when determining if stdout is read.

	* testsuite/configure.in: Brought up to TEA 3.5.
	* testsuite/aclocal.m4: New file, to import the TEA definitions.

	* Dbg.c: Added missed CONST in declaration and definition of
	  'debugger_trap'.

	* exp_command.c: Fixed pointer aliasing trouble with
	  'Tcl_DetachPids', and added the missing initialization of the
	  command string in the 'overlay' command.

	* expect.c: Fixed missing initialization of 'simple_start' element
	  of 'ecase'.

	* exp_inter.c: Fixed bogus use of 'slen' in 'intMatch'. The
	  relevant string is Tcl_Unichar, not Utf.

	* Makefile.in: Replaced bogus INSTALL_ROOT with DESTDIR, and added
	  missing DESTDIR references to the target for the installation of
	  the manpages.
