@.TH CRYPTDIR 1 "1 January 1993"
.SH NAME
cryptdir \- encrypt/decrypt all files in a directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cryptdir
[
.I dir
]
.br
.B decryptdir
[
.I dir
]
.SH INTRODUCTION
.B cryptdir
encrypts all files in the current directory (or the given directory
if one is provided as an argument).  When called as decryptdir
(i.e., same program, different name), all files are decrypted.

.SH NOTES
When encrypting, you are prompted twice for the password as a
precautionary measure.  It would be a disaster to encrypt files a
password that wasn't what you intended.

In contrast, when decrypting, you are only prompted once.  If it's the
wrong password, no harm done.

Encrypted files have the suffix .crypt appended.  This prevents files
from being encrypted twice.  The suffix is removed upon decryption.
Thus, you can easily add files to an encrypted directory and run
cryptdir on it without worrying about the already encrypted files.
.SH BUGS

The man page is longer than the program.
