@/* exp_rename.h - preface globals that appear in the expect library with "exp_"
so we don't conflict with the user.  This saves me having to use exp_XXX
throughout the expect program itself, which was written well before the library
when I didn't have to worry about name conflicts.

Written by: Don Libes, NIST, 12/3/90

Design and implementation of this program was paid for by U.S. tax
dollars.  Therefore it is public domain.  However, the author and NIST
would appreciate credit if this program or parts of it are used.  */
